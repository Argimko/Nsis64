ywjheart/Nsis64:

1.+ Added 64bit offset support, a single installer size can be up to 4GB.
2.+ Added data file support,and it can be multi data file. An installer size is nearly unlimited when used with data file(s).
3.+ Added command FileSize,SetDataFile off/auto/force
4.* Solved the false alarm with avira antivirus
5.- Removed solid compression support,I need time to add full support to it.
6.- Removed bzip2/zip compression support, mainly for easy compiling. You can add them back easily.

Argimko/Nsis64:
1.* Changed datafile name to setup-N.bin (originally: <exe-file-name>.N.dat)
2.* Converted project to Visual Studio 2010
3.+ Added compiled files

P.S. Really great solution from ywjheart:

P.P.S. It will be great to add extra parameter somthing like "datafilename", but, unfortunately, i'm not so good in c++
